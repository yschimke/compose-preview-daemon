/**
 * The last stride of a Wear `TransformingLazyColumn` walk lands at the content end, and landing
 * there reveals the `ScreenScaffold`'s `EdgeButton`: the last slice's bottom fifth is a bright
 * button where the previous slice, one stride earlier, had black scaffold background and a peek
 * pill. Every other row of the pair is a pixel-exact translation.
 *
 * `wear-edge-reveal/prev.png` and `next.png` are that pair verbatim from `:samples:wear`'s
 * `ActivityListLongPreview` (slices 5 and 6 of a 454 px Large Round walk; the driver measured the
 * stride at 156 px). Row profile at 156 px: rows 0–249 of `next` match `prev` at 0.0/px, rows
 * 250–297 are the EdgeButton against black at 40–160/px.
 *
 * The matcher used to score the whole overlap, so the revealed band dragged the true shift to a
 * 40/px residual — a `mismatch` verdict on a seam that is right — and, given only the scroller's
 * hint rather than a measured one, preferred a 198 px shift that lines the button up with a card
 * body (28/px) over the truth (40/px). Chrome that *appears* at the foot of a slice is not evidence
 * of misalignment: it is a contiguous run of disagreeing rows at the bottom of the overlap, and the
 * stitcher scores the rows above it.
