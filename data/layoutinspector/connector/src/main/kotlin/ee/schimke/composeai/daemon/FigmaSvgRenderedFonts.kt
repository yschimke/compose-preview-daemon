 * Those two look identical from inside the export — both arrive as a text node with no captured
 * family — but only one of them is a defect. A stock-Material preview genuinely has no explicit
 * `fontFamily` and correctly exports as Roboto; a branded preview that lost its family exports as
 * Roboto too, and that is how a whole sticker sheet shipped in the wrong typeface. The render is
 * the only place that knows which it was, so it publishes here and the export cross-checks.
 *
 * Populated by the Android render's font recorder (`FontResolverRecorder`) as resolutions happen,
 * rather than at post-capture: the recorder and the SVG export are independent post-capture
 * extensions with no ordering guarantee between them, so the data has to be in place before either
 * runs. Lives in this module because the export reads it and the recorder (in `:daemon:android`)
 * already depends on this one — the same direction `FontResolutionDiagnostics` is driven from two
 * render paths.
