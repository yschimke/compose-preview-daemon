/**
 * Issue #2615: a Wear surface whose fill arrives wrapped in a painter the resolver doesn't
 * recognise resolves no colour, so its container collapses to a whole-layer raster and takes the
 * editable subtree with it — the "transformed surfaces absent, reduced to isolated raster/icon
 * leaves" symptom on Jetcaster Wear's `TransformingLazyColumn` + `SurfaceTransformation` screens.
 *
 * `BackgroundPainter` was already unwrapped by name. These pin the *structural* unwrap that covers
 * whatever wrapper a given Wear component actually uses, without the resolver having to know its
 * class.
