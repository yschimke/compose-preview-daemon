/**
 * Process-static state holder for the plain-Compose named-override surface — the counterpart to
 * `RemoteComposeController`, minus the Remote-Compose-specific facets (host actions, platform
 * profile).
 *
 * Two responsibilities:
 *
 * 1. **Seeded values** — the daemon-supplied `name -> [PreviewOverrideValue]` map for the current
 *    render (`renderNow.overrides.namedOverrides`, keyed by [PreviewOverrideDeclaration.seedKey]).
 *    Snapshot-state so a `previewOverride*` lookup recomposes when the daemon pushes a fresh seed.
 * 2. **Declarations** — the ordered set of knobs the preview declared *this render* via its
 *    `previewOverride*` calls. Accumulated as the composition runs (deduped by `seedKey`,
 *    declaration order preserved) so a producer — the daemon's `compose/overrides` data product, or
 *    a standalone render's bundle-sidecar drain — can read back "what is editable on this preview".
 *
 * The controller is **always** the fallback host (see [LocalPreviewOverrideHost]) so a plain Gradle
 * render with no daemon still records declarations (with no seeds, every lookup returns its author
 * default). When the connector's around-composable is active it seeds values through [set] before
 * the preview composes.
 *
 * Writers can be on any thread — the daemon's render thread for seeding, the composition thread for
 * [record]. Snapshot-state + a copy-on-write listener list carry cross-thread propagation.
 *
 * **Android sandbox bridge.** On the Android daemon a preview composes inside a Robolectric sandbox
 * classloader, so the controller's static state is a *different instance* from the one the
 * host-side `PreviewOverridesDataProductRegistry` reads. To make
 * `data/fetch?kind=compose/overrides` work there, every [record] / [clearDeclarations] /
 * [resetForNewSession] also forwards to the do-not-acquire `SandboxPreviewOverridesBridge`
 * singleton — reached **reflectively** so this consumer-facing runtime keeps its
 * no-`:daemon:android` dependency shape. When the bridge class isn't on the classpath (a plain app,
 * the desktop daemon, connector unit tests) the forward is a cheap no-op and the in-classloader
 * state is the only source of truth. Mirrors `PermissionsController`'s `SandboxPermissionsBridge`
 * forwarding.
