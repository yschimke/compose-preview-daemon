 * Pure-JVM coverage of [AccessibilityLabels.announcement] — what a screen reader says for an

 *
 * ATF's own `ViewHierarchyElement` needs a real `View` graph to construct, so the trees here are
 * hand-built through [AccessibilityLabels.Element]. That the shapes are the ones ATF really
 * produces is measured separately, against a rendered Wear button, by `:renderer-android`'s
