/**
 * Opts a `@Preview` composable into focus-state capture.
 *
 * The compose-preview Gradle plugin's discovery task picks this up by FQN, mirroring the
 * [ScrollingPreview] / [AnimatedPreview] split: consumers that want to use the annotation in their
 * own code depend on `ee.schimke.composeai:preview-annotations`.
 *
 * Two driving modes — pick one:
 *
 * * **Indexed** ([indices]): fan out one capture per requested tab-order index. The renderer issues
 *   `moveFocus(Enter)` once on the first capture, then `moveFocus(Next)` to walk forward to each
 *   subsequent index. Filename suffix `_FOCUS_<index>`. Default mode (`indices = [0]`).
 *
 * * **Traversal** ([traverse]): one capture per direction in the array. The renderer issues
 *   `moveFocus(Enter)` once before the first step, then `moveFocus(direction)` per entry. Filename
 *   suffix `_FOCUS_step<n>_<direction>`. Useful for asserting Tab / Shift-Tab / D-pad traversal
 *   order in PR diffs — each step is a separate PNG so reviewers see exactly which focusable each
 *   move lands on.
 *
 * `traverse` takes precedence when both are set; mixing them in a single annotation isn't
 * meaningful.
 *
 * Compose's `Modifier.clickable` registers its focusable with `Focusability.SystemDefined`, which
 * refuses focus while the host `LocalInputModeManager.inputMode == InputMode.Touch`. Robolectric's
 * renderer environment is permanently in touch mode (no real key input ever arrives), so this
 * annotation also flips `LocalInputModeManager` to Keyboard mode for the duration of its captures —
 * matching the state a real device is in after the user Tabs to a component.
 *
 * Example — indexed:
 * ```
 * @Preview
 * @FocusedPreview(indices = [0, 1, 2, 3])
 * @Composable
 * fun MyButtonRow() {
 *     Row {
 *         listOf("Save", "Edit", "Share", "Delete").forEach { label ->
 *             Button(onClick = {}) { Text(label) }
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Example — traversal:
 * ```
 * @Preview
 * @FocusedPreview(traverse = [FocusDirection.Next, FocusDirection.Next, FocusDirection.Previous])
 * @Composable
 * fun MyButtonRow() { ... }
 * ```
 *
 * When [overlay] is `true`, the renderer draws a stroke + index label over the captured PNG showing
 * the bounds of the currently-focused element. Useful when the component's own focus indicator is
 * subtle and you want an unambiguous review-time marker.

   * that the per-PNG path uses — so consumer code stays plain `Row { Button(...) }` with no

   * Opt-in for previews whose root layout carries the `focusProperties { onEnter = {
   * initialFocus.requestFocus(); cancelFocusChange() } }.focusGroup()` order-control pattern
   * documented at `developer.android.com/develop/xr/jetpack-xr-sdk/jetpack-compose-glimmer/focus`.
   *
   * The renderer's default focus walk assumes `FocusManager.moveFocus(Enter)` parks focus on an
   * internal root *before* any focusable, so it advances `tabIndex + 1` Next steps to land on
   * focusable `tabIndex`. A `focusGroup` whose `onEnter` calls `initialFocus.requestFocus()` breaks
   * that assumption — `Enter` lands focus directly on the requested child, and the `+1 Next` then
   * advances past it to the wrong item. Setting `enterPlacesFocus = true` flips the walk to
   * `tabIndex` Next steps for the first capture, so `@FocusedPreview(indices = [0],
   * enterPlacesFocus = true)` captures the `focusGroup`'s `onEnter`-placed focus where it lands,
   * with no extra advance.
   *
   * Only meaningful for indexed-mode captures (`indices`); traversal-mode captures ([traverse])
   * issue one `moveFocus(Enter)` followed by directional steps, none of which apply the `+1`
   * compensation. Off by default — opt in per-preview when the root composable uses the
   * `focusGroup` pattern.

  /**
   * When `true`, the renderer dispatches an indirect-pointer Press event onto the focused
   * composable after the focus walk lands, before capturing pixels. The composable renders in its
   * pressed visual state — `Modifier.clickable`'s `PressInteraction.Press` is emitted to the
   * focused element's interaction source, so material ripples / Glimmer's brighter pressed surface
   * appear in the PNG.
   *
   * Indirect-pointer dispatch (rather than synthetic `MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN` on the View) is
   * required for **XR Glasses**: the display has no touchscreen, so input arrives from the
   * temple-mounted touchpad as `IndirectPointerEvent`s through Compose UI's
   * `AndroidComposeView.sendIndirectPointerEvent`. Glimmer's `Modifier.onIndirectPointerGesture` is
   * the only consumer that routes those events into per-modifier `onClick` / `onSwipeForward` /
   * `onSwipeBackward` lambdas, and it always targets the currently-focused composable — so this
   * flag pairs naturally with `indices` (focus the n-th focusable, then press it). For plain
   * touch-screen surfaces (`Modifier.clickable` on a phone-style preview) the same Press still
   * dispatches via the focus-targeted indirect-pointer path: `Modifier.clickable` registers a
   * fallback indirect-pointer handler, so the visual still arrives.
   *
   * Only meaningful for indexed-mode captures (`indices`) — traversal-mode (`traverse`) doesn't
   * carry a "settle and press" point. Off by default; opt in per-preview when you want the
   * pressed-state capture in addition to (or instead of) the focused-state capture.
