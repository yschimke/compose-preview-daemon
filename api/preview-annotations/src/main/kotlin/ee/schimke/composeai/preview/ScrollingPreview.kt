/**
 * Opts a `@Preview` composable into scrolling-screenshot capture.
 *
 * The compose-preview Gradle plugin's discovery task picks this up by FQN, independently of whether
 * the annotation artifact is on the consumer's compile classpath at plugin-apply time. Consumers
 * that want to use the annotation in their own code depend on
 * `ee.schimke.composeai:preview-annotations`.
 *
 * TOP / END produce normal preview captures. LONG and GIF are mapped to data products
 * (`render/scroll/long`, `render/scroll/gif`) so tooling can request them without giving them a
 * privileged place in the primary preview carousel. Shared knobs — [axis], [maxScrollPx],
 * [reduceMotion] — apply to every output produced by a single annotation instance.
