// `:slot-preview-runtime` — composable-helper authoring path for **structured-screen slots**.
//
// `PreviewSlot("leadingIcon") { … }` marks a named region of a preview so a structured-screen
// builder (the design-parity Figma plugin) can fill it with a child component. It is a **no-op in a
// normal render** — it just draws its content, tagged with `testTag = "dp-slot:<name>"` so the
// region is captured into the semantics tree with its bounds (which the `/render/<id>.slots` route
// reads). Under `LocalSlotMode` (the daemon's `slotMode` render override, follow-up) it renders a
// translucent labelled `SlotPlaceholder` instead, so a designer sees exactly where each slot is and
// drops a composable into that precise box.
//
// **Kotlin Multiplatform** (jvm + wasmJs) so the marker is callable from a KMP consumer's
// `commonMain` — the shared catalog bodies in `:samples:design-catalog-m3-shared` (jvm + wasmJs),
// whose slots then show on both the desktop render sheet and the in-browser wasm tier. No Android
// target: an `androidJvm` consumer resolves the `jvm` variant, and declaring one would stamp a
// `minSdk` floor onto the artifact for no benefit (same rationale as `:preview-annotations`,
// #2185).
//
// Standalone on purpose — no compile dep on the renderer. The renderer/daemon depend *onto* this
// module to `CompositionLocalProvider(LocalSlotMode provides …)` around the rendered content,
// exactly as they do for `:lottie-preview-runtime`'s `LocalLottieProgress`.
