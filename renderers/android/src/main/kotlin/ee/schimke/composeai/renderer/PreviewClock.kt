/**
 * The wall clock a preview render sees — pinned to a fixed instant so a preview that shows the time
 * produces the same PNG on every run (issue #3239).
 *
 * ## The bug this fixes
 *
 * Robolectric's `SystemClock` is deterministic under `LooperMode.PAUSED` — it starts at 100ms since
 * boot and only moves when something advances it. `System.currentTimeMillis()` is NOT: Robolectric
 * rewrites that call into [org.robolectric.shadows.ShadowSystem.currentTimeMillis] only inside
 * *instrumented* classes, and the instrumented set is `android.`, `com.android.internal.`, a
 * handful of XML parsers — plus whatever `instrumentedPackages` names. Everything else (the
 * consumer's own code, and every library) reads the host's real wall clock. So any surface that
 * paints the time re-renders differently every minute, with no source change, and the visual-diff
 * bot reports it as a real diff on every PR.
 *
 * That hits [AppTourRenderer]'s `kind=ACTIVITY` / `kind=APP_TOUR` lane hardest, because there the
 * *app's own* top-level screen is the subject and there is no seam to inject a fixed clock through
 * — an authored `@Preview` can pass `TimeText(timeSource = FixedPreviewTimeSource)` (see
 * `:samples:wear`), an activity hero cannot. On Wear that is close to every activity preview:
 * `TimeText` is standard furniture inside `AppScaffold`.
 *
 * ## How it is fixed
 *
 * [ShadowWearTimeSource] replaces the one function Wear reads the clock through and returns
 * [currentTimeMillis]. Two halves, and **both are load-bearing** — exactly like the coil pair in
 * [ShadowAsyncImagePainter]: the shadow has to be registered (generated `robolectric.properties`
 * for the Gradle path, `SandboxHoldingRunner` for the daemon), and its target class has to be
 * instrumented, because Robolectric cannot shadow a class it did not rewrite.
 *
 * ### Why not move `SystemClock` instead
 *
 * `SystemClock.setCurrentTimeMillis(fixed)` would make every *instrumented* `currentTimeMillis()`
 * read the pinned value in one stroke, which looks tidier. It is worse in four concrete ways, and
 * they're the reason this is a shadow:
 * - Robolectric's paused clock **only moves forward**, so a pre-1970 or otherwise-earlier instant
 *   is silently ignored rather than applied.
 * - Setting it is a ~54-year jump from 100ms-past-the-epoch, which makes every already-scheduled
 *   delayed message overdue. Anything a consumer `Application.onCreate` posted (and with
 *   `useConsumerApplication = true` that runs before the test method) fires at the next idle.
 * - It leaves `SystemClock.uptimeMillis()` reporting 54 years of uptime.
 * - It has to happen *before* anything else in every render entry point, which is an ordering
 *   contract that quietly breaks the moment a lane early-returns (the daemon's scroll and
 *   `figma-svg-long` modes do exactly that).
 *
 * A shadow has none of those: it is read at call time, it holds no state, and it cannot be reached
 * out of order.
 *
 * ## What it cannot reach
 *
 * `java.` is on Robolectric's do-not-acquire list, so `Calendar.getInstance()`, `new Date()` and
 * `java.time.*.now()` read the host clock from inside the JDK where no rewrite is possible. A
 * preview that formats `LocalTime.now()` itself still drifts; the fix for that one is the authoring
 * seam (hoist the clock, or branch on `LocalInspectionMode`), not the renderer.
 *
 * The Desktop / CMP lane has no Robolectric and therefore no interception point at all, so this is
 * an Android-only guarantee — see [ee.schimke.composeai.plugin.PreviewExtension.fixedTime].
 *
 * ## Configuring it
 *
 * `-Dcomposeai.render.fixedTime=…` on the render JVM, forwarded from `-PcomposePreview.fixedTime=…`
 * or the `composePreview.fixedTime` DSL value by the Gradle plugin. Accepts:
 * - `HH:mm` / `HH:mm:ss` — that time on [FIXED_DATE], in the render JVM's default zone. The default
 *   is [DEFAULT_TIME] (`10:10`), the same literal `:samples:wear`'s `FixedPreviewTimeSource` and the
 *   Wear/Remote design catalogs already paint.
 * - an ISO-8601 local date-time (`2024-01-01T10:10`) — when the date matters too.
 * - a bare epoch-millis number.
 * - `off` (also `false` / `none`) — don't pin; [currentTimeMillis] hands back the host wall clock
 *   and renders drift exactly as they did before this existed.
