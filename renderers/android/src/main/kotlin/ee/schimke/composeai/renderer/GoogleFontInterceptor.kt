/**
 * Cache and CSS-API helpers that underpin [ShadowFontsContractCompat].
 *
 * `Font(GoogleFont("Lato"), provider)` on a real device goes through
 * `androidx.core.provider.FontsContractCompat.requestFont` → GMS Fonts' ContentProvider. That
 * provider doesn't exist in the Robolectric sandbox: no `com.google.android.gms` package, no
 * registered content provider for `com.google.android.gms.fonts`. Compose's internal
 * `GoogleFontTypefaceLoader` swallows the failure into its async fallback and text silently renders
 * in the platform default (Roboto) — which is why consumers hit the "my downloadable fonts aren't
 * applied in screenshots" symptom when they try to capture previews that use their production
 * GoogleFont typography.
 *
 * The fix ships as a Robolectric shadow ([ShadowFontsContractCompat]) that intercepts `requestFont`
 * before the provider lookup even runs: parse the `FontRequest.query` (the same wire format
 * Compose's `GoogleFont.kt` builds), resolve a TTF from a local cache keyed by `(name, weight,
 * italic)`, and call the supplied callback synchronously with a [Typeface.createFromFile].
 *
 * The cache lives in a shared, machine-local directory (`$XDG_CACHE_HOME/composeai/fonts`, else
 * `~/.cache/composeai/fonts`) — a font keyed by `(family, weight, italic)` is identical across
 * projects, so it resolves once per machine and is reused by every render thereafter. The cache
 * directory is plumbed via the `composeai.fonts.cacheDir` system property by the plugin's
 * `composePreviewRender` `Test` task.
 *
 * Consumer code is unchanged: the same `Font(GoogleFont(...))` that runs on device renders under
 * Robolectric with zero `src/debug` fork, zero `testImplementation` opt-in, zero plugin
 * configuration.

 * already resolved. It failed exactly where it mattered: a catalog render whose font cache was
 * warm (so the PNG is correct) but whose egress is closed, or which runs
 * `composeai.fonts.offline`, produced an SVG with no `@font-face` at all, so browsers fell back to
 * sans-serif and every glyph width, line break and ellipsis drifted from the PNG (issue #2906).

/**
 * Render-time surfacing for downloadable-font resolution failures.
 *
 * A `Font(GoogleFont(...))` that can't be resolved — offline, no cache dir, a failed download, or a
 * family/weight Google serves no TTF for — is reported to Compose by [ShadowFontsContractCompat],
 * which then *silently* substitutes the platform default (Roboto). That's the "my branded fonts
 * aren't applied in screenshots" symptom: a preview that asks for Orbitron renders in Roboto with no
 * trace in the render log to say which face fell back or why. That output is *wrong* — a branded
 * sticker rendered in the wrong typeface — so by default the renderer treats a fallback as a
 * **fatal** per-preview error (the render loop drops the PNG and writes the usual `.error.json`).
 *
 * Opt out with `-Dcomposeai.fonts.failOnFallback=false` to downgrade a fallback to a non-fatal
 * warning: the PNG is kept and the fell-back faces are recorded in a `<png>.warnings.json` sidecar
 * instead. Use that for a deliberately-offline render, or a catalog that genuinely tolerates the
 * substitute face.
 *
 * Collection is per-preview: the render loop calls [beginPreview] before a render and [drainPreview]
 * after, so each preview only owns the fonts *it* asked for. A one-line stderr note is emitted once
 * per distinct `(family, weight, italic)` per process (a catalog render asks for the same face
 * hundreds of times) — matching the daemon's other self-diagnostics, surfaced in the VS Code
 * extension as `[daemon stderr] …`.
