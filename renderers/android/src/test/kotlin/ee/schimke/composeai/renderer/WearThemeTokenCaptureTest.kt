/**
 * What the inspector can say about a **Wear** button's label — issue #4327.
 *
 * The viewer's typography layer drew Wear text as `15.0sp/18.0sp · 500` and nothing else: no
 * typeface, no Material role. Both halves of that are measurable here rather than by reasoning
 * about a rendered page, and both are Wear-specific, so a Material 3 test would keep passing
 * whatever happened to Wear:
 *
 * - **The typeface.** Wear Material 3 declares its ramp with `Font(DeviceFontFamilyName(…))`, the
 *   one `Font` shape that exposes neither a resource id nor a file identity — so the resolved-face
 *   lookup returned null and the annotation named no font at all.
 * - **The Material role.** Role attribution matches a node's resolved style against the theme's
 *   token table, and for a Wear render that table was empty: the daemon reads it through Material 3
 *   types a Wear app does not have on its classpath.
