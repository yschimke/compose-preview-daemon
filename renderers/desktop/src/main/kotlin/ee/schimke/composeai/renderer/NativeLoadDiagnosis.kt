/**
 * Turns a native-loading failure into one sentence a human can act on, and remembers the first one
 * so the cascade behind it stops pretending to be 1000 unrelated bugs (issue #3690).
 *
 * ## What it is for
 *
 * Skia arrives through `libskiko-linux-x64.so`. When that `.so` cannot be loaded, the *first*
 * preview to touch Skia throws `ExceptionInInitializerError` carrying the real reason, and every
 * later preview in the same JVM throws `NoClassDefFoundError: Could not initialize class
 * org.jetbrains.skia.Surface` carrying nothing at all. On a 1073-preview catalog that is one usable
 * error and 1072 red herrings — the reported experience in issue #3690, where the real cause (a
 * package-store `libpthread` pulled into a system-glibc JVM) was buried under the cascade.
 *
 * So: [diagnose] both *explains* the real failure and *latches* it, and any later "could not
 * initialize class org.jetbrains.skia…" is reported as a cascade of that same cause. The latch is
 * per-JVM, which is exactly the scope of the problem — a fresh render fork rediscovers its own
 * first failure, and a pooled worker carries the one it already found.
 *
 * Pure string work over an already-thrown `Throwable`, so it costs nothing on the happy path and is
 * unit-testable without a broken loader.
