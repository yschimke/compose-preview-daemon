 * Renders one `@FocusedPreview` capture on Compose Multiplatform Desktop: focus is walked with a
 * real `FocusManager.moveFocus(...)` traversal and, for `pressed = true`, a real pointer press is
 * dispatched onto the focused element through the scene's hit-testing input path.
 *
 * ## Why this exists (issue #3672)
 *
 * Until now `@FocusedPreview` was Android-only: discovery emitted the per-capture focus state on
 * every target, but the desktop lane ignored it, so a CMP preview asking for focus rendered its
 * resting frame. Samples that wanted a focused / pressed sticker had no option but to emit
 * `FocusInteraction.Focus` / `PressInteraction.Press` onto a `MutableInteractionSource` from a
 * `LaunchedEffect` — a forged visual: nothing is really focused, nothing is really pressed, the
 * emission is never paired with `Unfocus` / `Release`, and a component whose indication reads the
 * focus system rather than the interaction source captures no differently from an untouched one.
 * This path replaces that with input the component actually receives.
 *
 * ## Why `runSkikoComposeUiTest` rather than `ImageComposeScene`
 *
 * Same reason [renderScrollPreview] uses it: `ImageComposeScene` is a bare rendering surface with
 * no `mainClock` and no way to inject input. The focus walk needs a paused clock (Material's focus
 * / press state layers crossfade over ~150 ms and the capture has to land *after* the fade), and
 * `pressed` needs a pointer-injection host. `runSkikoComposeUiTest` gives the renderer what
 * `AndroidComposeTestRule` gives the Robolectric path.
 *
 * ## How pressing differs from the Android path, on purpose
 *
 * The Android connector dispatches an **indirect** pointer event (`sendIndirectPointerEvent`),
 * because XR Glasses have no touchscreen and route touchpad input to whatever is *focused*. Desktop
 * has no indirect-pointer channel at all, so the press here is an ordinary pointer down aimed at
 * the focused element's bounds — which is strictly more evidence, not less: the event is hit-tested
 * to the component like a real click, so a capture can only show the pressed state if the real
 * component (not merely its state layer) received the press.
 *
 * As on Android the press is deliberately **not** released before the capture: a Press+Release pair
 * is a tap, which would fire `onClick` and leave the button resting again. The held press is the
 * "finger still down" shape the sticker documents. The scene is disposed at the end of the capture,
 * so nothing outlives it.
 *
 * Returns `true` when [outputFile] was written, `false` when the walk found nothing focusable — the
 * caller falls back to the ordinary single-frame render so a misuse still produces a capture.
