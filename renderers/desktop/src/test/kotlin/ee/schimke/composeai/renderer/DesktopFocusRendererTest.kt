/**
 * Desktop counterpart of `:samples:android-alpha`'s `FocusedPreviewPixelTest`: proves that
 * `@FocusedPreview` on a **Compose Multiplatform Desktop** module drives real focus (and, with
 * `pressed = true`, a real pointer press) rather than rendering the resting frame N times.
 *
 * Before this path existed the desktop renderer ignored the per-capture focus state discovery had
 * already emitted, which is why the CMP catalog forged its focused / pressed stickers with a held
 * `MutableInteractionSource` (issue #3672). Each test here fails if that regression returns: the
 * fixture is plain `Button`s with no interaction source of their own, so a capture can only differ
 * from the undriven one when the component actually received the input.
