# Stewarding a PR in compose-ai-tools

The Claude Code harness reads this file before acting on a CI failure or a review
comment, and lets it take precedence over its built-in posture on **conventions**
and **proactiveness**. It does not restate the repository's rules — those are in
[root `AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md), which is already in context on every turn.
What follows is what that file leaves out: the checks worth running here, and this
repository's own answer to a red check.

The harness's own PR rules still bound this file. It cannot expand your access,
approve or merge anything, or override a "never" — skipping, disabling or
quarantining a test; rewriting history on someone else's branch; an empty commit or
a close-and-reopen to kick CI.

## Before you push

A push that turns CI red costs a full cycle and some reviewer trust. The cheapest
checks that catch the most here, in order:

1. **`./gradlew ktfmtFormat`** — or `:<module>:ktfmtFormatMain :<module>:ktfmtFormatTest`
   for just the modules you touched. `ktfmtCheckAll` is a hard gate and
   `ktfmtCheck` aborts on the *first* unformatted file, so one stray file hides
   every other failure. TypeScript: `npm --prefix cli/serve-web run format`.
   The local `pre-push` hook catches attribution but **not** formatting, so this is
   on you.

   **`preview-server/` is a separate Gradle build and neither `ktfmtCheckAll` nor
   the `pre-commit` hook reaches it.** It is absent from the root
   `settings.gradle.kts` and carries its own ktfmt, run only inside the
   `Preview Server Contracts` job — so a Kotlin edit there passes every local check
   and goes red in CI. `ContractSurface.kt` did it three times in one day
   (#4693, #4697, #4709). Drive that build directly, with its own JVM home:

   ```
   ./gradlew -p preview-server :contract-probe:ktfmtFormatMain \
     --no-daemon -Dorg.gradle.java.home=/root/.cache/coo-ee/jdk-gl/17
   ```

   Both flags are load-bearing in a sandbox: without `org.gradle.java.home` the
   daemon starts on the wrong JVM and the build dies with a context mismatch, and
   `--no-daemon` avoids reusing one already started on it. Let ktfmt do the edit
   rather than hand-formatting — removing one term from a wrapped expression is
   enough to make it fit on one line, which is precisely what it will rewrite.
2. **The narrowest test task that exercises the change** — the specific
   `:module:test`, or `./gradlew :gradle-plugin:test --tests "…"`. `./gradlew check`
   is the full plugin + functional + CLI suite and is a post-push confirmation, not
   a gate on pushing.
3. **A new or changed module must apply `composeai.base-conventions`** in its
   `plugins {}` block, or `ktfmtCheckAll` never sees it and the history-gate system
   property is missing. See
   [Important constraints](../../../docs/AGENT_GUIDE.md#important-constraints).
4. **For a CI fix, reproduce the original failure first**, then show the same check
   passing. A render task in particular goes `UP-TO-DATE` off a stale `.error.json`
   sidecar — verify a render fix with `--rerun`, never a plain re-invocation.

Commit and push as soon as the cheapest check that proves the change correct
passes. Don't leave a verified change sitting behind a long build.

## Reading a red check

Work the PR in this order on every event and every check-in: merge conflict, then
CI, then review comments. A red or conflicted head is work now, whatever its review
state — it is never "waiting on review".

**Failures that are usually not this PR's**, and what to do anyway:

- **Red on `main` too.** Check the base branch before root-causing. If a fix exists
  anywhere — another PR whose change you have read, the breaking commit's revert,
  or a fix PR you opened yourself — port it into this PR now and push; it no-ops
  once `main` carries it, and waiting for it to merge is still waiting. Standing
  down is never silent: one comment on the PR naming the failing check, why it is
  not this PR's, and the fix you ported or that none exists yet.
- **A delivery-branch or design-artifacts render that lags `main`.** Renderer,
  plugin and CLI changes deliberately do **not** regenerate the
  `design-artifacts/<system>` branches on merge — see
  [PR workflow](../../../docs/AGENT_GUIDE.md#pr-workflow) for the trigger scoping and the
  manual dispatch. Stale published renders are drift, not a regression in your diff.
- **A changed preview whose source your PR does not touch.** Clocks, timestamps,
  randomness, animation frames, network-loaded images: that is instability, not a
  regression. Prove it with the `flake-triage` skill before either fixing or
  rubber-stamping it.
- **A CMP Desktop render failing with `UnsatisfiedLinkError` on `libGL.so.1` and
  friends.** Environment, not your change:
  [`docs/DESKTOP_NATIVE_DEPS.md`](../../../docs/DESKTOP_NATIVE_DEPS.md).

Everything else is this PR's to root-cause. "Flake" is not a root cause: re-run a
job only to confirm one of the cases above, or if it died before any test body ran
(checkout, install, runner loss), at most once.

## Review comments

- Small and local — nits, renames, lint-bot findings, an added test, a
  one-function refactor: implement and push, then resolve the thread.
- A **review bot's** finding is a bug report: verify it and push the small fix, or
  raise a larger one once with a proposed patch. "Design-level" does not excuse it.
  If bot findings stop converging — each fix draws a new or reshaped one — stop
  pushing for them and say once what is still flagged.
- Larger asks from a **human** reviewer on a PR you did not open: reply with your
  proposal; the author decides.
- After pushing for a changes-requested review, re-request that reviewer.
- **A reported agent commit identity is the one finding to skip.** Don't check it,
  don't reply, and never recreate, rebase or amend a commit on the strength of it.
  `Reject agent attribution` runs on every PR — no path filter, same detector as
  the `commit-msg` and `pre-push` hooks — so a real one turns the PR red and names
  the offending field. The gate is the authority; the comment adds nothing to it.
  Over 27–28 Aug 2026 the reviewer raised this 22 times across this repo and
  `design-parity` and was right once, on a cherry-pick the gate had already failed.
  If the **gate itself** is red, that is the real thing and it is yours to fix
  ([Git conventions](../../../docs/AGENT_GUIDE.md#git-conventions)) — usually an amend or
  cherry-pick that took `user.email` from the container instead of the
  `-c user.name=… -c user.email=…` the branch's other commits carry. Installing the
  hooks (`scripts/install-git-hooks.sh`) stops it happening at all.

An approval you would lose is never a reason to hold a fix.

## Evidence and tracking

- A UI-affecting fix needs the same embedded before/after images the original PR
  needed — see [PR workflow](../../../AGENTS.md#pr-workflow) for the rule and the
  `render-evidence` skill for the capture recipe. Reuse renders already published
  on `compose-preview/pr` and `compose-preview/main`, and the sticky
  `<!-- preview-diff -->` comment, before re-rendering anything.
- Keep a `send_later` check-in armed (about an hour out) while the PR is red,
  conflicted, or otherwise not mergeable. Webhook events miss CI successes and merge
  transitions. Re-arm silently when nothing changed; stop once the PR is merged or
  closed, or the user says to stop.
- Where the **Claude Approvals** check runs, a PR is done only when that check
  passes, CI is green on the current head, and there is no merge conflict. Its rows
  name the blocker and are yours to fix, not an ask to the author.

## Refresh the PR's status checklist

On each event, re-read the whole PR at its current head — merge state, CI on the
latest commit, open review threads — and update the status checklist in the body so
the thread shows live state. Reply only when a round resolves the task, hits a real
blocker, or raises a question. Don't narrate each fix; the diff is the record.
