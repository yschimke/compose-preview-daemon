// Sidecar metadata schema — see docs/daemon/HISTORY.md § "Sidecar metadata
// schema". The kotlinx-serialization JSON shape is the on-disk format the
// daemon writes (and that consumers read back via `history/list` and
// `history/read`) so any field added or renamed here is wire-format-visible.
// Schema versioning rules (HISTORY.md § "File-format versioning") allow new
// optional fields without a version bump; readers ignore unknowns.

/**
 * One history entry — a single render observation captured to disk by the daemon.
 *
 * Field-by-field cross-reference to HISTORY.md § "Sidecar metadata schema":
 * - **Identity** — [id], [previewId], [module], [timestamp].
 * - **Bytes** — [pngHash] (full hex SHA-256), [pngSize], [pngPath] (relative to the sidecar).
 * - **Provenance (producer)** — [producer] (always `"daemon"` for entries this server writes;
 *   `"gradle"` / `"manual"` reserved for future producers), [trigger], [triggerDetail].
 * - **Provenance (storage source)** — [source]. For H1 always `kind: "fs"`.
 * - **Provenance (worktree + git)** — [worktree], [git]. Resolved at daemon startup; refreshed
 *   per-render where cheap. Both are nullable so a non-git workspace still produces valid entries.
 * - **Render context** — [renderTookMs], [metrics] (mirrors `RenderFinishedParams.metrics`).
 * - **Preview metadata** — [previewMetadata]. Frozen at render time.
 * - **Optional delta** — [previousId] + [deltaFromPrevious]. The first render of a preview has
 *   `previousId == null` and `deltaFromPrevious == null`. H1 leaves the pixel-mode fields
 *   ([HistoryDelta.diffPx], [HistoryDelta.ssim]) as `null`; H5 will populate them.
 * - **Semantics snapshot** — [semantics]. The `compose/semantics` payload captured alongside this
 *   render, frozen so `history/diff mode=SEMANTICS` (issue #1785) can diff two entries' trees
 *   structurally — the cheap, pixel-free regression signal. Null when the producer didn't compute
 *   semantics for this render (e.g. stub hosts, renders that never subscribed the kind). Heavy, so
 *   it lives only in the per-entry sidecar: it's stripped from the lean `index.jsonl` (like
 *   [previewMetadata]) and never echoed on the `history/list` / `history/read` / `historyAdded`
 *   wire surfaces — only `history/diff mode=SEMANTICS` reads it back off disk.
 * - **Data-product snapshots** — [a11yAtf], [a11yHierarchy], [a11yTouchTargets], [theme]. The
 *   per-render `a11y/atf`, `a11y/hierarchy`, `a11y/touchTargets` and `compose/theme` payloads
 *   captured alongside this render (issue #1869), so history covers structured **data**, not just
 *   pixels — a later data diff can answer "what were this preview's a11y findings a commit ago?".
 *   Each is null when the producer didn't compute that kind for this pass. The a11y kinds are
 *   captured only on an a11y-mode render: their artefacts are file-backed and not cleared between
 *   renders, so a normal render must NOT freeze a prior a11y render's stale files (the freshness
 *   gate lives in `JsonRpcServer.recordHistoryForRender`). Otherwise handled exactly like
 *   [semantics]: heavy, sidecar-only, stripped from `index.jsonl` and the wire surfaces; the
 *   reporting-branch writer (issue #1870) projects them into the per-product files (`a11y.json`,
 *   `theme.json`, …) described in docs/daemon/REPORTING-BRANCH.md, validated by the published
 *   schemas under `schema/`.
