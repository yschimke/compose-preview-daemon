/**
 * Pure target resolution against the Android backend's **flat probe-semantics snapshot**
 * ([RecordingProbeNode] list, issue #2519). The desktop backend resolves a [SemanticsInputTarget]
 * against a live unmerged semantics tree via `SemanticsTargets.resolve`; Android only ever sees the
 * flat snapshot bridged out of the Robolectric sandbox, so this is its equivalent resolver — kept
 * in `:daemon:core` and free of any Compose / Robolectric dependency so it is unit-testable without
 * standing up a held scene.
 *
 * **What it matches (and why not `ref`).** The snapshot carries `testTag`, `role`, the node's own
 * `text`, its merged descendant text ([RecordingProbeNode.mergedText]), and `contentDescription` —
 * but no stable [ref][SemanticsInputTarget.ref] (refs are assigned on the tree the snapshot was
 * flattened from and don't survive into it). So a `ref` target resolves to
 * [ProbeTargetResolution.Unsupported] rather than silently matching nothing — a false
 * `assert.notVisible` pass is worse than a clear "unsupported" failure. The other target shapes
 * resolve by the most specific field present:
 * - `testTag` → nodes whose `testTag` equals it (the pre-#2519 behaviour).
 * - `role` + `text` → nodes whose `role` equals it **and** whose [effectiveText] equals the text,
 *   so a `Button { Text("Add") }` (role on the button, text merged up from the child) matches.
 * - `text` alone → nodes whose **own** `text` (or [contentDescription], for an icon-only control)
 *   equals it — deliberately *not* [effectiveText]. A merged-text container and the child text node
 *   it merged always coexist in the flat snapshot, so matching merged text here would return both
 *   for `text: "Add"` and make `assert.textEquals` ambiguous; the child text node carries the
 *   visible text for a text-only find, mirroring the desktop `hasText` finder.
 * - `role` alone → nodes whose `role` equals it.
 */

/**

 * answer `role`+`text` and `assert.textEquals` the same way.
