/**
 * Renderer-agnostic seam between [JsonRpcServer] and the per-target render backend — see
 * docs/daemon/DESIGN.md § 4 ("Renderer-agnostic surface").
 *
 * One implementation per backend:
 *
 * - `RobolectricHost` (in `:daemon:android`) holds a Robolectric sandbox open via the dummy-`@Test`
 *   runner trick (DESIGN.md § 9) and bridges work across the sandbox classloader boundary.
 * - `DesktopHost` (planned, in `:daemon:desktop`, Stream B-desktop) holds a long-lived
 *   `Recomposer` + Skiko `Surface` warm.
 *
 * The surface is intentionally minimal: only the methods [JsonRpcServer] actually invokes ([start],
 * [submit], [shutdown]) plus the shared monotonic id source via [Companion.nextRequestId]. New
 * methods only appear here when `JsonRpcServer` needs them on every backend; per-backend extras
 * stay on the concrete class.
 *
 * **Threading contract.** Implementations expose a single render thread — see the
 * no-mid-render-cancellation invariant in DESIGN.md § 9. [submit] blocks the caller until the host
 * returns a [RenderResult]; [JsonRpcServer] already runs each `submit` on a fire-and-forget worker
 * so the JSON-RPC read loop is never blocked.
