/**
 * Cross-classloader handoff for the runtime-permissions query tracker (issue #1400).
 *
 * **Why a sibling of [DaemonHostBridge].** `PermissionsController.recordQuery(...)` fires from
 * inside the Robolectric sandbox — `ShadowContextWrapperPermissionTracker` intercepts
 * `ContextWrapper.checkPermission(...)` for every consumer `ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(...)`
 * read, and the shadow runs in sandbox-instrumented code. The sandbox classloader acquires the
 * `ee.schimke.composeai.daemon` package by default, so the controller's static state is loaded
 * fresh per-sandbox and the daemon-host `PermissionsDataProductRegistry` (constructed once on the
 * host thread, in the host classloader) sees an empty `queried` list when it reads
 * `PermissionsController.queried.value` for the `compose/permissions` data product. The grants
 * leg works because the host-side planner sets the host-CL controller directly; queries have no
 * such host-side write path.
 *
 * This bridge is registered as a do-not-acquire package on [SandboxHoldingRunner], so the same
 * single instance is visible from both sides of the sandbox boundary. The shadow's controller
 * call pushes to [recordQuery] here; the host registry drains via [snapshot] / [reset].
 *
 * **Strict bridge-package rules.** Only `java.util.concurrent.*` types and primitives. No
 * Compose, no Robolectric, no `ee.schimke.composeai.*` imports — those would drag the bridge
 * back into the instrumented graph and break the single-instance invariant.
 *
 * **State shape.** A single concurrent map per JVM keyed by permission name, valued by a
 * monotonic arrival counter so [snapshot] can return the unique permissions in insertion order
 * (the same shape `PermissionsController.queriedSet` produces in-process). Cumulative across
 * renders within the active interactive session; [reset] is the per-session cleanup hook that
 * `PermissionsController.resetForNewSession` calls.
