/**
 * An endlessly-running Compose animation keeps producing new frames in a held live session.
 *
 * This is the property the whole live lane rests on for the components that never come to rest — an
 * indeterminate progress indicator, a shimmer, a `rememberInfiniteTransition` of any kind. They
 * have no settled state to reach, so "did the frame change?" is the only evidence that the held
 * composition's clock is moving at all, and a still frame is indistinguishable from a preview
 * served off the baked snapshot lane. That ambiguity is what makes it worth pinning: when someone
 * reports a live indeterminate indicator sitting motionless, the first thing to rule out is that
 * the daemon stopped advancing it.
 *
 * It also guards the **idle backoff** from the far side. That backoff keys off consecutive
 * byte-identical frames, so a preview that genuinely never stops moving must never trip it — the
 * run has to keep resetting. An infinite animation is the strongest case: if anything here ever
 * starts returning identical frames, the backoff would quietly throttle a preview that is still
 * animating, and this test fails before that can ship.
