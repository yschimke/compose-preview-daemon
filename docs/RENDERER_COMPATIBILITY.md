# Renderer compatibility notes

The renderer ships as `ee.schimke.composeai:renderer-android` (an AAR) and is
resolved into each consumer project's `composePreviewAndroidRenderer<Variant>`
configuration. AGP's `process<Variant>Resources` builds the unit-test merged
resource APK (`apk-for-local-test.ap_`) from the consumer's **own** dep graph,
so if a transitive pulls a newer AndroidX AAR into the test classpath than the
consumer's main variant declares, classes and resources disagree at runtime.

**Don't catalogue the specific failure modes here anymore — run
`compose-preview doctor --explain` in the consumer project.** The plugin's
`CompatRules` owns the current list of known AAR/R.id mismatches, and `doctor`
prints the rationale, the triggering library, and the remediation per finding.
The VS Code extension surfaces the same findings in the Problems panel (via
`:<module>:composePreviewDoctor` → `build/compose-previews/doctor.json`).

## What still lives here

- **When to add a rule.** A new rule goes into
  [`CompatRules.kt`](../gradle-plugin/src/main/kotlin/ee/schimke/composeai/plugin/tooling/CompatRules.kt)
  when a new AndroidX AAR adds an R.id field that older transitives don't
  have, or when Gradle can select a platform sibling whose bytecode shape does
  not match the Android renderer's expectations. Add a test in
  `CompatRulesTest.kt` with both the triggering and non-triggering paths.
- **The four mitigation mechanisms** in the renderer/plugin that must move
  together — remove any one and the compat matrix re-opens:
  1. `compileOnly` for Compose / Activity / UI-test libs in
     [`renderer-android/build.gradle.kts`](../renderer-android/build.gradle.kts).
     Consumer's versions win at runtime, so classes match their APK.
  2. `rendererConfig.extendsFrom(testConfig)` in
     [`AndroidPreviewSupport.kt`](../gradle-plugin/src/main/kotlin/ee/schimke/composeai/plugin/AndroidPreviewSupport.kt).
     Renderer transitives resolve in the same Gradle graph as consumer test
     deps — one coherent max-version set, no per-JAR classpath-ordering
     hazards.
  3. Unconditional injection of `androidx.compose.ui:ui-test-manifest` into
     `testImplementation` (same file). AGP's manifest merger only walks the
     consumer's declared deps — the renderer AAR transitively carrying the
     activity entry isn't enough.
  4. KMP sibling substitution on the Android renderer configuration (same
     file). AndroidX and Compose Multiplatform publish platform-specific
     coordinates such as `foo-android`, `foo-desktop`, and `foo-jvmstubs`.
     Consumers without the Kotlin Android plugin's platform-type compatibility
     rule can resolve desktop/JVM-stub siblings on an Android unit-test
     classpath. The renderer config rewrites scoped `androidx.*` and
     `org.jetbrains.compose.*` `-desktop` / `-jvmstubs` requests to the matching
     `-android` coordinate; `compose-preview doctor` reports the same skew for
     the consumer's own test tasks.

## Tile-rendering defaults

Tile previews render on an opaque black background and pick up the round
device crop automatically — both happen unconditionally for
`params.kind == PreviewKind.TILE` in `TilePreviewRenderer` and
`RobolectricRenderTest` respectively. Consumers that want something other
than black can paint inside the tile itself; the hosting FrameLayout's
background is intentionally not exposed as a knob since it mirrors the
watchface substrate, not the tile's own surface.
