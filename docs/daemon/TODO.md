# Preview daemon — work breakdown & parallelisation

> Read [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) first. This file enumerates concrete work items, their dependencies, and how to split them across parallel agents.

## How to use this file

- **Phases** are chronological gates — Phase N must complete before Phase N+1 starts.
- **Streams** within a phase run in parallel. Each stream is sized to fit one focused agent.
- **Each task** has explicit `Depends on` IDs and a **DoD** (definition of done) — when an agent completes a task, the DoD is what the reviewer checks.
- Tasks marked **[shared seam]** modify code visible to other streams. Schedule those serially and notify other agents when merged.

## Branching strategy for parallel agents

- One worktree per agent: `agent/preview-daemon-streamA`, `agent/preview-daemon-streamB`, etc.
- All branch from `agent/preview-daemon-design` (the docs branch — these design docs are the contract).
- Each stream opens its own PR against `main`. Sequential merges in dependency order.
- Phase 0 changes go to a single integration branch first; everyone rebases on it before Phase 1.

---

## Phase 0 — foundations (sequential, blocks everything)

These must land first because every other stream consumes them. Single agent or pair-coordinated; small but load-bearing.

### P0.1 — Capture latency baseline [Stream D]

Build `:samples:android-daemon-bench` (skeleton sample module) with a `benchPreviewLatency` task that times the existing Gradle `renderPreviews` path: cold, warm-no-edit, warm-after-1-line-edit. Output CSV with phase breakdown (config, compile, discovery, fork, render).

- **Depends on:** none
- **DoD:** CSV checked into `docs/daemon/baseline-latency.csv` for the reference dev machine. Numbers referenced from `DESIGN.md` § 13 are validated or corrected.

### P0.2 — Add `sourceFile` to `PreviewInfo` [Stream A] [shared seam]

Extend `PreviewInfo` (in `gradle-plugin/.../PreviewData.kt`) with `sourceFile: String?` populated from `ClassInfo.sourceFile` (ClassGraph exposes the bytecode `SourceFile` attribute). Wire through `DiscoverPreviewsTask`. Update `previews.json` schema.

- **Depends on:** none
- **DoD:** existing `:samples:android:renderAllPreviews` still passes. New field present in generated `previews.json` and surfaced in `PreviewInfo` consumers. Functional test asserts non-null for at least one preview in `samples/android`.

### P0.3 — Hoist classpath/JVM-args helpers [Stream A] [shared seam]

Extract `buildTestClasspath(variant)` and `buildJvmArgs(variant)` from `AndroidPreviewSupport.kt` into a package-private `AndroidPreviewClasspath.kt`. Existing `registerAndroidTasks` calls the helpers instead of inlining. Behaviour must be byte-identical.

- **Depends on:** none
- **DoD:** `:gradle-plugin:functionalTest` passes unchanged. `:samples:android:renderAllPreviews` produces identical PNGs to `main` (manual diff check in PR description).

### P0.4 — Lock IPC protocol [Streams B + C, joint] [shared seam]

Define the JSON-RPC protocol in `docs/daemon/PROTOCOL.md` (new file). Lock message shapes for `setVisible`, `setFocus`, `fileChanged`, `renderNow`, `shutdown`, `discoveryUpdated`, `renderStarted/Finished/Failed`, `classpathDirty`, `sandboxRecycle`, `daemonWarming`. Include JSON examples and field semantics.

- **Depends on:** none
- **DoD:** doc merged. Both Kotlin (`Messages.kt`) and TypeScript (`daemonProtocol.ts`) types in later phases reference it as the source of truth.

---

## Phase 1 — first end-to-end render (parallel)

Goal: a daemon JVM that can be spawned by VS Code and render a single preview to PNG behind the feature flag. No optimisations, no recycle, no incremental anything.

### Stream A — Gradle bootstrap

#### A1.1 — `composePreviewDaemonStart` task

New `DaemonBootstrapTask` that, given a variant, emits `build/compose-previews/daemon-launch.json` containing: classpath JARs, JVM args, system properties, java launcher path. Uses helpers from P0.3.

- **Depends on:** P0.3
- **DoD:** running `./gradlew :samples:android:composePreviewDaemonStart` writes a valid descriptor that, when manually exec'd as `java @args`, starts a JVM that loads `RobolectricHost.main()`.

#### A1.2 — `DaemonExtension` DSL

Add `composePreview.experimental.daemon { … }` extension with `enabled`, `maxHeapMb`, `maxRendersPerSandbox`, `warmSpare` fields. No-op when disabled. Documented in `docs/daemon/CONFIG.md` (new).

- **Depends on:** A1.1
- **DoD:** unit test on the extension's defaults. README of daemon docs links to config doc.

### Stream B — daemon core

#### B1.1 — Module skeleton

Create `renderer-android-daemon/` module. `build.gradle.kts` depends on `renderer-android` + Robolectric + kotlinx-serialization. Empty `DaemonMain.kt` that prints "hello" and exits.

- **Depends on:** none
- **DoD:** `./gradlew :renderer-android-daemon:assemble` succeeds. Manual `java -cp ... DaemonMainKt` prints "hello".

#### B1.2 — `Messages.kt` protocol types

`@Serializable` Kotlin data classes mirroring P0.4. One file under `daemon/protocol/`.

- **Depends on:** P0.4, B1.1
- **DoD:** unit test round-trips one of each message via `Json.encodeToString` / `decodeFromString`.

#### B1.3 — `DaemonHost` (sandbox holder)

A class that runs a single dummy `@Test` whose body blocks on `LinkedBlockingQueue<RenderRequest>`. Submitting a request triggers a render in the sandbox thread; result returned via callback.

- **Depends on:** B1.1
- **DoD:** unit test: submit 10 dummy renders to a single host instance; all complete; sandbox classloader is reused (assert via reflection on `Thread.currentThread().contextClassLoader.hashCode()`).

#### B1.4 — `RenderEngine` (per-preview body)

Duplicate the relevant parts of `RobolectricRenderTest`'s render body into `RenderEngine.kt`. Inputs: `PreviewInfo`, output dir. Output: `RenderResult { pngPath, tookMs }`. **Comment in the file noting the duplication and the reconciliation v2 plan.**

- **Depends on:** B1.3
- **DoD:** rendered PNG of one `samples/android` preview via `RenderEngine` is byte-identical (or pixel-identical with no AA drift) to the same preview rendered via `RobolectricRenderTest`.

#### B1.5 — `JsonRpcServer` over stdio

Read line-delimited JSON from stdin, dispatch to handlers, write replies/notifications to stdout. Single-threaded dispatch onto the host's render queue.

- **Depends on:** B1.2, B1.3
- **DoD:** integration test: spawn the daemon JVM as a subprocess, send `renderNow` for one preview, assert the PNG appears and a `renderFinished` notification is read back.

#### B1.6 — `SandboxScope` + `ProcessCache` helpers

Implement the helpers from `DESIGN.md` § 11. Add the lint check (script under `gradle-plugin/build-logic/`) that fails the daemon module's build if `companion object` / `object` declarations hold Compose/AndroidX/Android-typed fields.

- **Depends on:** B1.1
- **DoD:** unit test: `SandboxScope.activeSandboxCount()` decreases by one after dropping a sandbox + 2 GCs. Lint check: introduce a deliberate violation; build fails with helpful message.

#### B1.7 — Wrap `GoogleFontInterceptor` and `ShadowPackageManager` adds

In the daemon module, add wrappers that delegate to the existing `renderer-android` helpers but route mutable state through `SandboxScope`. Per-preview prologue/epilogue in `RenderEngine` reverses ShadowPackageManager adds.

- **Depends on:** B1.4, B1.6
- **DoD:** integration test: render preview A (which adds activity X to the package manager), then preview B. Assert preview B's `PackageManager` does **not** contain activity X.

### Stream C — VS Code client

#### C1.1 — `daemonProtocol.ts` types

TypeScript types mirroring P0.4. Match field names exactly.

- **Depends on:** P0.4
- **DoD:** lint passes. Unit test serialises one of each message and validates against the JSON-shape definitions in P0.4.

#### C1.2 — `daemonProcess.ts` lifecycle

Spawn the daemon JVM (using the descriptor from A1.1), monitor process health, watchdog on parent-PID exit, restart on `classpathDirty`, idle timeout shutdown.

- **Depends on:** A1.1, C1.1
- **DoD:** unit test (mocked child process): spawn, send shutdown, child exits cleanly. Restart on simulated `classpathDirty` notification.

#### C1.3 — `daemonClient.ts` JSON-RPC client

Stdio JSON-RPC over the spawned process. Methods mirror those used by `gradleService.ts` (specifically `renderPreviews`, `discoverPreviews`).

- **Depends on:** B1.5, C1.2
- **DoD:** integration test against the real daemon JAR: spawn, render one preview from `samples/android`, PNG appears, returned manifest matches expected shape.

#### C1.4 — `daemonGate.ts` router shim

Read `composePreview.experimental.daemon` setting. If enabled and daemon healthy → use `daemonClient`; else fall back to `gradleService`. One call site in `extension.ts`. On daemon failure, log + notification + auto-fallback for the remainder of the session.

- **Depends on:** C1.3
- **DoD:** manual smoke test in VS Code: enable flag, observe daemon spawn on first preview action, render works. Disable flag, observe normal Gradle path.

---

## Phase 2 — productionise (parallel)

Goal: the daemon is fast enough and stable enough to be the recommended path for daily editor use, even if still flagged.

### Stream B — daemon hardening

#### B2.1 — `ClasspathFingerprint` (Tier 1)

SHA over `libs.versions.toml`, all `build.gradle.kts`, `settings.gradle.kts`, `gradle.properties`, `local.properties`. Re-check on file change in those paths. Authoritative SHA over resolved classpath JAR list at startup. On hit: emit `classpathDirty`, exit cleanly.

- **Depends on:** B1.5
- **DoD:** integration test: bump a version in `libs.versions.toml` while daemon running; daemon emits `classpathDirty` and exits within 2s.

#### B2.2 — `IncrementalDiscovery` (Tier 2)

Scoped ClassGraph scan of a single classpath element. Regex pre-filter for `@Preview` on saved files outside the existing preview-bearing set. Diff against cached `previews.json`. Emit `discoveryUpdated`.

- **Depends on:** P0.2, B1.5
- **DoD:** unit test: synthetic project with 100 preview-bearing classes; edit one; discovery completes in < 100ms; diff is exactly that one class's previews.

#### B2.3 — `SandboxLifecycle` measurement (Layer 1)

Per-render: heap post-GC, native heap, class histogram for tracked classes, render time, sandbox age. Emitted on `renderFinished.metrics`.

- **Depends on:** B1.5
- **DoD:** soak test runs 100 renders; CSV shows all metrics populated; no measurement adds > 10ms to render time.

#### B2.4 — Active leak detection (Layer 2)

Weak-reference probe every Nth render. `--detect-leaks=heavy` flag wires LeakCanary JVM-test. JFR ring buffer always on; dumped on `leakSuspected` or `sandboxRecycle`.

- **Depends on:** B2.3
- **DoD:** synthetic leak (deliberately retain Activity ref) detected within 50 renders. JFR dump appears in `.compose-preview-history/leaks/`.

#### B2.5 — Recycle policy + warm spare (Layer 3)

Triggers from `DESIGN.md` § 9. `active`/`spare` slots; background spare builder. Recycle = atomic swap + teardown old + start new spare. `daemonWarming` notification when spare not ready.

- **Depends on:** B1.3, B2.3
- **DoD:** integration test: force recycle (via `maxRendersPerSandbox=10`), assert no user-visible pause (next render starts within 50ms of swap). Spare always ready except in deliberate spare-blocked test.

#### B2.6 — Sandbox teardown verification

WeakReference to sandbox classloader; force GC after recycle; emit `sandboxLeaked` if classloader not collected within 2 GCs. After 3 events, exit cleanly.

- **Depends on:** B2.5
- **DoD:** synthetic leak (deliberately pin classloader from process-level cache); first recycle emits `sandboxLeaked`; daemon exits after 3 events.

### Stream C — VS Code refinements

#### C2.1 — Visibility tracking from webview

Webview reports preview cards entering/leaving viewport (IntersectionObserver). Extension translates into `setVisible({ ids })` to daemon.

- **Depends on:** C1.4
- **DoD:** manual: scroll panel; daemon log shows `setVisible` updates with correct IDs.

#### C2.2 — Focus signal

On hover / click / file scope change, send `setFocus({ ids })` (subset of visible).

- **Depends on:** C2.1
- **DoD:** manual: click a preview card; daemon renders that one first when multiple are stale.

#### C2.3 — Daemon-warming UX

Render `daemonWarming` and `sandboxRecycle` notifications as a non-blocking status indicator in the panel.

- **Depends on:** B2.5, C1.4
- **DoD:** visual review of status indicator during a forced recycle.

### Stream D — bench & CI

#### D2.1 — Daemon-mode bench

Extend P0.1 bench to include daemon-mode timings: spawn cost, first-render cost, warm-render cost, edit-then-render cost. Same CSV format.

- **Depends on:** B1.5, P0.1
- **DoD:** `docs/daemon/baseline-latency.csv` updated with daemon columns. PR description includes ratio analysis.

#### D2.2 — Pixel-diff CI gate

CI job that runs `samples:android-daemon-bench:renderAll` (daemon path) and pixel-diffs against `samples:android:renderAllPreviews` (Gradle path). Must be 100% identical.

- **Depends on:** B1.7, D2.1
- **DoD:** GitHub Actions workflow added; job green on this branch; deliberately introduce a render bug → job fails with diff image artifact.

#### D2.3 — Soak test in CI

Runs nightly. 1000 renders in a single sandbox on `samples/android`. Asserts: no OOM, heap drift < 50MB, zero `sandboxLeaked`, ≤ 2 `sandboxRecycle`.

- **Depends on:** B2.5, B2.6
- **DoD:** workflow green; metrics summary posted as workflow output.

---

## Phase 3 — un-flag decision (sequential)

### P3.1 — Documentation

`docs/daemon/USER_GUIDE.md` covering: how to enable, what to expect, how to disable, what to do when something goes wrong (classpath dirty loops, persistent leaks, fallback to Gradle). Update VS Code extension README with the experimental flag.

- **Depends on:** all of Phase 2
- **DoD:** doc reviewed; one external developer uses it to enable the daemon end-to-end without further questions.

### P3.2 — Acceptance review

All CI gates from `DESIGN.md` § 15 green. Bench numbers meet the < 1s focused-preview target. Soak stable for one week of nightly runs.

- **Depends on:** D2.2, D2.3
- **DoD:** PR opened to flip the default of `composePreview.experimental.daemon` from `false` → still `false` but with "stable preview" label; or hold at experimental for another release cycle.

## Suggested agent assignment

Four parallel agents after Phase 0 lands:

| Agent | Streams | Focus | Worktree |
|-------|---------|-------|----------|
| **Agent A — Plugin** | A1.1, A1.2 | Gradle plugin Kotlin; JVM bootstrap descriptor | `agent/preview-daemon-streamA` |
| **Agent B — Daemon core** | B1.1–B1.7, then B2.1–B2.6 | Robolectric/Compose internals; sandbox lifecycle; leak detection | `agent/preview-daemon-streamB` |
| **Agent C — VS Code** | C1.1–C1.4, then C2.1–C2.3 | TypeScript; extension UX; webview wiring | `agent/preview-daemon-streamC` |
| **Agent D — Bench/CI** | P0.1, D2.1–D2.3 | Benchmarking; CI workflows; pixel-diff infra | `agent/preview-daemon-streamD` |

Agent B is the largest — could split internally as B1 (core renderer + protocol + scope discipline) and B2 (lifecycle + leak detection + tier classifications) into two sub-agents once Phase 1 lands. They coordinate via the `RobolectricHost` + `RenderEngine` interfaces, which are stable after B1.5.

### Coordination rules

- **Phase 0 first.** No parallel work until P0.1–P0.4 are merged. They define the contracts other streams depend on.
- **Protocol changes go through P0.4's doc.** Any change to message shapes during Phase 1+ requires an explicit PR to `PROTOCOL.md` first; both Stream B and Stream C rebase before continuing.
- **No edits to existing `renderer-android` code in Phase 1.** Stream B duplicates the render body. Refactoring the original is a v2 task tracked separately.
- **Shared-seam tasks merge serially.** P0.2 and P0.3 cannot land in the same PR; Agent A handles them one at a time.
- **Daily sync via PR descriptions.** Each stream's PR description includes "interfaces I depend on" and "interfaces I expose" — review on those terms.

### Sequencing diagram

Phase 3:  P3.1 ── P3.2                              
```

A1.1 unblocks C1.2; B1.5 unblocks C1.3; B2.5 unblocks C2.3. Otherwise streams are mostly independent within a phase.

---

## Risks to track per task

If an agent hits one of these mid-task, raise immediately rather than working around it:

- **B1.3 sandbox-reuse failure.** If the dummy-`@Test` blocking pattern doesn't actually keep the sandbox classloader alive across `LinkedBlockingQueue` waits, escalate. We may need to invoke Robolectric's lower-level `Sandbox` API directly.
- **B1.4 render-body extraction reveals coupling.** If the duplicated render body needs more than mechanical copy-paste to work outside `@Test`, document the divergence and plan reconciliation earlier.
- **B1.7 ShadowPackageManager add-reversal incomplete.** If we can't enumerate what we added, a sandbox reset between previews is the fallback (slower; defeats v1 perf target). Escalate.
- **B2.5 warm-spare cost too high.** If two sandboxes use > 2GB combined, default `warmSpare=false` and accept the recycle pause. Document.
- **D2.2 daemon and Gradle paths produce different PNGs.** Block until reconciled. This is the canary for divergence; never paper over.
