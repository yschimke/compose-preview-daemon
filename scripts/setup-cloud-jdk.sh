# Provision Temurin JDKs that trust the sandbox's TLS-intercepting egress
# proxy, for cloud environments where Gradle toolchain auto-provisioning
# (which goes through api.foojay.io) is blocked by an allowlist network
# policy.
#
# Historically this placed a single JDK 17 on disk — the project toolchain
# pinned in `gradle/gradle-daemon-jvm.properties`. But the render subprocess
# now forks on a JDK chosen to match the *consumer's* bytecode target (see
# `RenderJvmSelection` in the Gradle plugin): a consumer whose modules compile
# to Java 21 needs a JDK 21 the render can fork into, or every preview fails
# with `UnsupportedClassVersionError`. In a sandbox where foojay is blocked,
# that JDK has to be on disk out-of-band too — so this script now provisions a
# *set* of JDK majors (default: 17 21 25) and symlinks each into
# `/usr/lib/jvm` so Gradle toolchain detection finds them.
#
# Two problems this solves, both specific to locked-down cloud sandboxes
# (the Claude Code on the web "custom" network mode is the motivating case):
#
#  1. **Missing JDK major.** The container commonly ships only one JDK, but
#     the daemon toolchain and the per-consumer render toolchain may need
#     others. Gradle's toolchain auto-provision goes through api.foojay.io,
#     which an allowlist network policy blocks — so the JDKs have to be
#     placed on disk. Adoptium publishes Temurin as GitHub release assets,
#     which allowlists that permit github.com *do* serve.
#
#     Caveat that shapes how the release tag is resolved below: some sandboxes
#     gate github.com *per repository* rather than wholesale. Claude Code on
#     the web scopes github.com to the session's attached repos, so a request
#     to `adoptium/temurin17-binaries` comes back 403 — while the release
#     *asset* download (which redirects out to objects.githubusercontent.com)
#     is still served normally. So tag resolution cannot rely on github.com,
#     even though the download can. See `resolve_latest_tag`.
#
#  2. **MITM proxy CA not trusted by a freshly-downloaded JDK.** The sandbox
#     proxy terminates TLS with its own CA. The OS trust store (and the
#     system JDK, whose `cacerts` symlinks to it) carries that CA, which is
#     why `curl` and the pre-installed JDK work. A Temurin tarball straight
#     from Adoptium ships the vanilla Adoptium trust store *without* the proxy
#     CA, so every Java-side HTTPS fetch (Gradle wrapper distribution, Maven
#     Central / Google Maven dependency resolution) fails with:
#       PKIX path building failed: unable to find valid certification path
#       to requested target
#     The fix is to copy the system Java trust store over Temurin's.
#
# Nothing is downloaded for a major this box already has — where "has" means a
# full JDK, compiler included, since a JRE is no use as a Gradle toolchain.
# Reuse is checked in two places: this script's own install dir, and then the
# JDKs actually present — `java` on PATH, `$JAVA_HOME`, and the directories
# Gradle scans for toolchains. That second check is the difference between working and dead on a
# container provisioned by something else: a Nix-installed Temurin symlinked
# into `/usr/lib/jvm` is a perfectly good JDK 17, and going to Adoptium for
# another one fails outright where github.com is gated per repository. See
# `discover_jdk_home`.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/setup-cloud-jdk.sh [PRIMARY_INSTALL_DIR]
#
# Env (override defaults):
#   CLOUD_JDK_MAJORS  space-separated JDK majors to provision
#                     (default: "17 21 25"). The FIRST is the "primary" — its
#                     JAVA_HOME is printed on stdout for
#                     `export JAVA_HOME=$(scripts/setup-cloud-jdk.sh)`.
#   JDK17_VERSION     pin the primary's Temurin tag (back-compat alias for the
#                     primary major when it is 17; default: latest GA). A pinned
#                     tag names a specific build, so it also opts that major out
#                     of reusing whatever JDK happens to be on the box.
#   JDK17_DIR         primary install dir (default: /opt/jdk<primary>, or arg 1).
#   JDK<major>_DIR    install dir for a specific major (default: /opt/jdk<major>).
#   JDK<major>_VERSION pin a specific major's Temurin tag (default: latest GA).
#   CLOUD_JDK_REUSE_EXISTING
#                     `0` to always download, even when a JDK of that major is
#                     already installed elsewhere (default: reuse).
#   CLOUD_JDK_SEARCH_DIRS
#                     space-separated globs searched for existing JDKs
#                     (default: "/usr/lib/jvm/* /opt/jdk* /opt/*jdk*
#                     $HOME/.sdkman/candidates/java/*").
#   CLOUD_JDK_JVM_LINK_DIR
#                     where the toolchain symlinks are written
#                     (default: /usr/lib/jvm).
#
# Output: prints the absolute JAVA_HOME of the PRIMARY JDK on stdout.
# Additional majors are best-effort: a major Adoptium hasn't published yet
# (or a transient download failure) logs a warning and is skipped rather than
# failing the whole run — the primary JDK and any that did install are still
# usable.

#     sails past the `[[ -z "$tag" ]]` guard.
#   * `set -e` does not catch the failed curl. `pipefail` is set, so the
#     pipeline does report curl's status — but bash suppresses `-e` for a
#     failure raised inside a function that is itself running in a command
#     substitution being assigned (`primary_home="$(install_major "$major")"`),
